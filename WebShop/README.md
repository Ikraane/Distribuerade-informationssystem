# HPlusSample
A side working-on project, testing all fanctionalities from the tutorial project and adding them to our official project.
The jdk used in this application is 17.0.2. Tomcat 9 is used here, but I think Tomcat should work as well.

## Set up the dadabase first before you start the app. Open the hplus.sql file, located in databasestatements-folder, in MySQL Workbench query file and run the commands.
## Add the Tomcat Runner and Smart Tomcat to your plugins in Intellij, and run the application using Tomcat Runner.
